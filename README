To run this code, 

Need to do several things:
Actually, I think I can upload the matrix and dictionary to the github since its smaller.

But incase a file, "user_song_matrix.npz" or the dictionary, "song_id_to_info.json" is NOT in your clone, do this:

1. Need to grab the csv labeled "all_users_data.csv" in the shared google drive. 
2. Skip to step 6 below.

If you want to update the csv with more data follow these steps (I.E. restart with all new data)
1. first import entire spotify_stream_data (Google Drive folder)
2. next, remove other files from the spotify_stream_data like README and the csv containing the tracker info. 
3. Next you want to create an empty folder called spotifyDatas
4. Now that you have the output folder, run the zip_to_folder.py script
5. then run mass_json_to_csv.py (Prepare for slow computer after this)
6. Once computer recovers, run the csv_to_matrix.py script. This will create a file "user_song_matrix.npz"

Now you should see a song_id_to_info.json file containing a dictionary along with a user_song_matrix.npz file which contains the sparse matrix.

I've added some query tests in "queryTests.py" which we can continue adding weird queries too.
